# RL-Optimized Quantum Circuit Decomposition

## Overview

This proof-of-concept project demonstrates a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimizing quantum circuit decomposition. By using RL to "learn" the best way to decompose quantum gates into native operations, the project aims to reduce circuit depth and error rates—key challenges in scalable quantum computing.

## Benefits for Infleqtion

- Enhanced Optimization:
Integrates ML-driven techniques with quantum compilation to achieve lower circuit depth and improved fidelity, aligning with Infleqtion’s focus on cross-layer hardware performance enhancement.
- Improved Error Mitigation:
Optimized decompositions can reduce error accumulation, leading to more robust quantum operations on neutral atom systems.
- Scalability:
The approach provides a foundation for automating circuit optimizations in larger systems, paving the way for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
- Foundation for Future Development:
Although currently a toy model, this prototype can be extended to work with real quantum simulators or hardware, offering a clear roadmap for further research and potential integration with Infleqtion’s Superstaq platform.
## Project Structure

- Custom Gym Environment:
Simulates a quantum circuit with a sequence of gates, where each gate can be decomposed using two options (optimal vs. suboptimal).
- Q-Learning Agent:
Learns to choose the optimal decomposition action (minimal cost) for each gate.
- Training & Evaluation:
Provides scripts and visualizations to monitor training progress and evaluate performance.

## Future Work

- Integration with Real Quantum Simulators:
Extend the prototype to interface with Qiskit or Infleqtion’s Superstaq for hardware-aware optimizations.
- Advanced RL Techniques:
Incorporate more sophisticated RL methods to handle complex circuit decompositions.
- On-Hardware Testing:
Collaborate to test and refine the approach on Infleqtion’s neutral atom quantum processors.
